## Problem Statement

Small businesses and independent professionals (such as cafés, studios, or local agencies) often need a simple online presence to attract customers and receive inquiries. However, traditional web hosting solutions usually require managing servers, scaling infrastructure, handling security updates, and paying fixed monthly costs—even when traffic is low.

The core problems are:
- High operational overhead for a basic website.
- Lack of scalability when traffic suddenly increases (promotions, social media exposure).
- Security risks from publicly exposed servers and misconfigured infrastructure.
- Unnecessary costs for always-on backend services that are rarely used.

This project addresses these issues by designing a **serverless, highly available, and cost-efficient architecture on AWS** that delivers a static website with a contact form. The solution leverages managed AWS services to eliminate server management, automatically scale with demand, enforce security best practices (private storage, HTTPS, least-privilege IAM), and follow a pay-per-use cost model.

The result is a real-world, production-oriented reference architecture that demonstrates how to design simple yet robust systems using AWS, aligned with the **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** principles.
